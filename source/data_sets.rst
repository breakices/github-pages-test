Data sets
===========

MultiCategory comes with six different multi-model data sets: simple e-commerce data set, Patent, Film, University, Person and Unibench data set.

If you download the Haskell version of MultiCategory, you will download all the data sets simultaneously. Notice that the data sets have been modified and cleaned certain ways
because Haskell is very strict that data follows the lines that typing sets for it. We have also made data sets smaller because originally the idea was not to create big data platform.

On the other hand, Python version does not come with most of the data. Python version is developded to support bigger data sets and this means that all the data sets can be uploaded 
into the demo system as they are presented. You can read more about installing the data sets from Install tab.
